# LandingPredictApp
An android app to connect to Arduinos and read telemetry data from a connected radio https://www.hopefuloverlook.casa/articles/high-power-rocketry/

This app reads in telemetry data strings from serial connection and uses that info to predict roughly where your kit rocket will land.

As of now it runs on arduino but doesnt read in data automatically from the serial connection. The connection is implemented, I just need to actually read the data and we're off to the races. More updates to come!
